# piano-cards

## About.

A react app to help learn piano via a flash card system. This app is currently in very early development. The app uses CRA and TailwindCSS.

## How To

Currently the app is being developed using Storybook, and so currently is just a collection of components. To run the current state:

`yarn install yarn run storybook`

## Aims.

This app is mostly intended to mirror the functionality of the popular flashcard software "Anki", albeit with some features that make it especially suited for learning piano. I am planning on adding staff support to the cards, along with a wide range of ready-made decks for learning scales and other technical challenges.

## Current state of the project.

Currently the project is a loose collection of components in a Storybook.

## Contribute.

If you want to contribute then you can email me or just directly make a pull request. Since the project is in very early stages there is little in way of conventions. I am fresh to the world of React applications so any help would be greatly appreciated.
